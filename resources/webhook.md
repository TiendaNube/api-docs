Webhook
=======

A Webhook is a tool that allows you to receive a notification for a certain event. It allows you to register an *https* URL which will receive the event data, stored in JSON. Webhooks can be registered for the following events:

| Category       | Events                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| App            | uninstalled/suspended/resumed                                                                    |
| Category       | created/updated/deleted                                                                          |
| Order          | created/updated/paid/packed/fulfilled/cancelled                                                  |
| Product        | created/updated/deleted                                                                          |
| Domain         | updated                                                                                          |
| Theme          | updated                                                                                          |

To register for the product created event, for example, you should send `product/created` in the event field.

The `app/suspended` and `app/resumed` events refer to the [suspension of API access due to lack of payment](https://github.com/TiendaNube/api-docs/#suspension-of-api-access-due-to-lack-of-payment).

You are not allowed to use a localhost/tiendanube/nuvemshop domain for webhooks.

To aid in your development you can use [RequestCatcher](https://requestcatcher.com/). PostCatcher is a web app that generates a unique url that you can use as a webhook endpoint and display any POST requests sent to it for you to examine.

Properties
----------

| Property       | Explanation                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id             | The unique numeric identifier for the Webhook                                                    |
| url            | The URL where the webhook should send the POST request when the event occurs. **Must be HTTPS**. |
| event          | The event that will trigger the webhook                                                          |
| created_at     | Date when the Webhook was created in [ISO 8601 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)    | 
| updated_at     | Date when the Webhook was last updated in [ISO 8601 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)|

### Verifying a webhook

Webhooks created through the API can be verified by calculating a digital signature.

Each Webhook request includes a X-Linkedstore-HMAC-SHA256 header which is generated using the app's secret, along with the data sent in the request.

__Note that some frameworks will change the header to HTTP_X_LINKEDSTORE_HMAC_SHA256__.

See PHP example below:

```php
<?php

define('APP_SECRET', 'secret');

function verify_webhook($data, $hmac_header) {
  return $hmac_header == hash_hmac('sha256', $data, APP_SECRET);
}

$hmac_header = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_LINKEDSTORE_HMAC_SHA256'];
$data = file_get_contents('php://input');
$verified = verify_webhook($data, $hmac_header);
echo 'Webhook verified: ' . var_export($verified, true);
```

### Parameters

When doing the POST request, all webhooks will send the following parameters in JSON format:

* __store_id__: Store from where the event originated (received as `user_id` at the [authentication](./authentication.md) step)
* __event__: Event's name (product/created, product/updated, etc.)

Also, every webhook will send custom parameters, as follows:

#### app/uninstalled

* __id__: App's id.

#### category/created - category/updated - category/deleted

* __id__: Category's id.

#### order/created - order/updated - order/paid - order/packed - order/fulfilled - order/cancelled

* __id__: Order's id.

#### product/created - product/updated - product/deleted

* __id__: Product's id.

#### domain/updated

No additional parameter is sent along with this event. To get the list of domains one may refer to [Store](https://github.com/tiendanube/api-docs/blob/master/resources/store.md) resources.

#### theme/updated

* __old_theme__: Old Theme's code.
* __new_theme__: New Theme's code.

#### Example webhook content

```javascript
{
  'store_id':123,
  'event':'product/created',
  'id':1948209
}
```

### Retry policies

A webhook notification expects a 200 status code in response (40 seconds timeout). If this does not happen (it gets another response code or no response at all) we will try to deliver the notification up to 17 times (a success response code will stop next notifications) along the next two days in incremental lapses of time. After this, the notification is lost.

Required Webhooks
---------

* store/redact - Requests deletion of store data.
* customers/redact - Requests deletion of customer data.
* customers/data_request - Requests to view stored customer data.

These webhooks help you manage the user data that an application uses. You must enter the addresses on the application's configuration page in the Partner's admin.

### store/redact
Request to delete store information. 48 hours after a store uninstalls your app, Nuvemshop|Tiendanube sends this webhook with the store ID so that you can delete the shopkeeper's information from your database.
Payload:

```javascript
{
   store_id: 123
}
```
### customers/redact
Request to erase consumer information. If the consumer did not place an order at the store 6 months ago, the webhook will be sent after 5 days. If the customer has placed an order in the last 6 months, the deleted order will be held until 6 months have passed.
Payload: 

```javascript
{
store_id: 123,
customer: {
	id: 1,
	email: email@email.com
	phone: +55...,
	identification: ... 
},
orders_to_redact: [213, 3415, 21515]
}
```
### customers/data_request
Request for customer information. It is the application's responsibility to send the information directly to the merchant.
Payload: 

```javascript

{
store_id: 123,
customer: {
	id: 1,
	email: email@email.com
	phone: +55...,
	identification: ...
},                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
orders_requested: [213, 3415, 21515],
data_request: {
	id: 456,
}
}
```
