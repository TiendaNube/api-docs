We provide to different kind of shipments. Shipments that will be shipped to a buyer's address (_ship_) or shipments that will be picked up by the buyer (_pickup_).

The response object rates must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. We need all required fields for the integration to work properly.

Server-side caching of requests
-------------------------------

We will provide server-side caching to reduce the number of requests done to your callback URLs. Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be retrieved from our cache of the initial response:

- variant ids
- variant quantities
- default shipping box weight and dimensions
- shipping carrier id
- origin address
- destination address
- item weights & dimensions

If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original request, then new shipping rates are requested.
