We provide authorization and user authentication by a restricted form of OAuth 2. In a glance:
- The only grant type we support is the "authorization code" one.
- Our access tokens don't expire. They become invalid only after you get a new one, or if the user uninstalls your app.
- Along with the access token we provide an `user_id`, which is the ID of the store. This is key: you need it for making requests to our API. It is also useful for authenticating app users on your website (see User authentication).

Introduction
------------

When creating an app, you have to select the scopes it needs and set a redirection URL.
The scopes specify the resources for which the app is asking authorization of its users (see Scopes).
The redirection URL is used as part of the authorization flow (see below).

Authorization flow
------------------

The authorization flow is pretty standard, except for the first step:

1. The user, from his TiendaNube/NuvemShop admin, clicks on a button to install your app. Or, alternatively, he goes to https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/(app_id)/authorize (if he is not logged in, he is prompted to do so).
2. He is redirected to a page where he has to authorize the scopes your app needs (if he has already done it, this step is skipped).
3. He is redirected to your app's redirection URL with an authorization code.
4. Using your app's credentials and the authorization code, you can obtain an access token by making a POST request to https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/authorize/token. (Don't forget to also send `grant_type=authorization_code`, see the example below).

Note: Any of these URLs in the tiendanube.com domain can be replaced for identical ones in the nuvemshop.com.br domain.

#### Example

Asume that your app has:
- id = 123
- redirection URL = https://www.example.com/
- scopes = `read_orders`, `write_products`
- client_secret = abcdef

1. Store with ID 789 goes to https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/123/authorize?state=csrf-code
2. User accepts.
3. He gets redirected to https://www.example.com/?code=xyz&state=csrf-code.
4. Then you do:

```sh
curl https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/authorize/token --data 'client_id=123&client_secret=abcdef&grant_type=authorization_code&code=xyz'
```

and receive:

```json
{
	"access_token":"61181d08b7e328d256736hdcb671c3ce50b8af5",
	"token_type":"bearer",
	"scope":"read_orders,write_products",
	"user_id":"789"
}
```

Scopes
------

Apps should only ask for the access scopes they need. If an app only needs to read products, it should only ask for the `read_products` scope.

__If you ask for any write scope, the read scope is implied.__

As [Webhooks](https://github.com/TiendaNube/api-docs/blob/master/resources/webhook.md) rely on other resources, you will only be able to register webhooks for the resources you were granted permission to use.

The available scopes for the API are:

* read_content / write_content
    - Page
* read_products / write_products
    - Product
    - Product Variant
    - Product Image
    - Category
* read_customers / write_customers
    - Customer
* read_orders / write_orders
    - Order
* read_coupons / write_coupons
    - Coupon
* write_scripts
    - Script
* write_shipping
    - Shipping Carrier


User authentication
-------------------

If you need your app's users to be able to sign-in on your website, you can reuse the Authorization flow for this purpose:
- The login button should be a link to https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/(app_id)/authorize.
- You can sign-in the user having the ID you receive with the new access token.
- In the link [you should](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) add a `state` parameter for CSRF protection (e.g. a hash of the session cookie), and check it after the redirection.
