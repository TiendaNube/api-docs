<h1 id="setting-up">Setting-up</h1>
<h3 id="partner-account-and-creation-of-the-app">Partner account and creation of the APP</h3>
<p>To interact with our APIs you have to create an APP. The APPs represent the products of our partners on our platform. Each APP has its own credentials, which are required to authenticate on our platform, as well as certain permissions to access the different scopes of our API. The steps to create a Shipping APP are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If your company does not yet have an account on our partner portal, you must create one by entering the following link</li>
  <li>Once inside the partner portal, an APP must be created ensuring that the fields are completed with real information. How to set up an APP (Portuguese version)</li>
  <li>It is important to pay close attention to the “Redirect URL” field, which is a key part of the APP installation process. Later it can be modified if necessary.</li>
  <li>You will surely want to include a good description of the application and the services offered, this information will be displayed in our App Store and other sections of our platform.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the category of the APP is “Shipping”.</li>
  <li>Very important: Once the APP is created, ensure that it has the following permission scopes enabled in the portal:
○ write_shipping 
○ Write_orders 
○ read_customers</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="app-installation">APP installation</h3>
<p>To obtain the authorization code. Use the following URL to start the installation flow in a store:
https://${store_name}.mitiendanube.com/admin/apps/${app_id}/authorize 
After the merchant approves the permissions, redirect the merchant to the URL redirect of the APP (defined in the configuration, along with the CODE in the URL)</p>

<h3 id="get-the-access_token">Get the access_token</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl --location --request POST 
'https://www.tiendanube.com/apps/authorize/token' \ 
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ --data-urlencode 'client_id=${client_id}' \ 
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=${client_secret}' \ 
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \ 
--data-urlencode 'code=${authorization_code}' 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h6 id="note-1">Note 1:</h6>
<p>We use placeholders to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>${code}: From the query string of the Redirect URL.</li>
  <li>${client_secret}</li>
  <li>${client_id} -</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="note-2">Note 2:</h6>
<p>${client_id} y ${app_id} represent the same value.</p>

<h3 id="creation-of-the-shipping-carrier">Creation of the Shipping Carrier</h3>
<p>In order for stores to view, activate and configure the new shipping method, a Carrier must be created. The carrier is the entity that represents the shipping company in Tíanube and it is to which all services are added. Each integrator partner must generate only 1 (one) Shipping Carrier.
To create the carrier, the following information must be provided.</p>
<ul>
  <li>name: The name of the logistics company.</li>
  <li>callback_url: It is the URL to which we are going to consult to obtain the shipping costs.</li>
  <li>types: indicates if the carrier supports ship (home delivery) and / or pickup (delivery at pickup point). In case of being the options, place both separated with a comma.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="example">Example:</h6>
<p>POST /shipping_carriers</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{ 
"name": "My Shipping Company", 
"callback_url": "https://example.com/rates", 
"types": "ship,pickup" 
}

<h3 id="create-shipping-services-carrier_option">Create shipping services (carrier_option)</h3>
<p>Once the carrier was created, the API returns the carrier’s data set, among these is the ID of the carrier in Tiendanube. This ID should be used to create the shipping services, hereinafter carrier_option.
The carrier options are the shipping services (shipping and pickup) offered by the carrier. Each carrier option represents a service, or set of services with similar characteristics that the company offers.
These appear in the shipping carrier configuration and users will be able to make configurations such as: enable / disable the service, indicate if the service supports free shipping, add cost and / or days additional to the shipping rates obtained.</p>

<h6 id="note-1-1">Note 1:</h6>
<p>Each carrier option (service) must have a unique CODE. That means that there cannot be 2 carrier_option with the same CODE.</p>
<h6 id="note-2-1">Note 2:</h6>
<p>A carrier option will only be able to answer 1 rate per inquiry. Otherwise, only the first one will be taken.</p>
<h6 id="note-3">Note 3:</h6>
<p>The configurations made by the user in Tiendanube should not affect the payload of the app. They will be applied exclusively by Tiedanube upon receiving the rates from the APP.</p>
<h6 id="note-4">Note 4:</h6>
<p>If the shipping method adds more shipping options, to reflect them in the stores, they must create the corresponding carrier_options in the stores that are customers of the APP. And add it as a new carrier_option when installing the APP.</p>
<h6 id="note-5">Note 5:</h6>
<p>The allow_free_shipping attribute must be created with the value False. The store owner will modify this configuration from the admin whenever he wishes.</p>

<h6 id="example-1">Example:</h6>
<p>**POST /shipping_carriers/#{carrier_id}/options 
POST /shipping_carriers/123/options **</p>

<p><a name="rates"></a></p>
<h2 id="shipping-rates">Shipping Rates</h2>
<p>Shipping rates are the results of shipping calculations for a cart. Every time a store requests a shipping calculation, our platform will make a request to the callback_url, informed in the creation of the carrier, with the information from the shopping cart. See more information. 
Below are the business rules to take into account when making shipping calculations.</p>
<h3 id="volumetry">Volumetry</h3>
<p>When receiving a request for a shipping calculation, the weight and dimensions of the products contained in the cart must be taken into account to offer the shipping options that are consistent with the products. It may happen that some products do not have weight and dimensions, in this case only offer options when the app has the necessary data to make the shipping calculation.</p>
<h3 id="treatment-of-rates">Treatment of rates</h3>
<p>Once the shipping options to return have been calculated, they should not be filtered or modified. Our platform will be responsible for displaying only those options based on the services that the store has activated, as well as adding the cost values and additional days.</p>
<h3 id="limits">Limits</h3>
<p>The results to be displayed in the calculator are limited by your amount of shipping rates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rates to Ship: 1 rate for carrier option (code).</li>
  <li>Rates to Pickup: Up to 10 rates per carrier option (code).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-code-parameter">The Code parameter</h3>
<p>The code parameter value represents each carrier option of the APP.
The shipping rates returned in the shipping calculation must have a CODE that corresponds to a carrier option. In this way we can apply the configurations made by the user on the carrier options in the administrator of his store.</p>

<h6 id="important">Important:</h6>
<p>Rates whose CODES do not correspond to a carrier option will not be displayed. Respect uppercase, lowercase and accents.</p>

<h6 id="example-2">Example:</h6>
<p>We have a carrier option that offers a fast delivery service with CODE “express”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{ 
"id": 123, 
"code": "express", 
"name": "Servicio express 24hs", 
"additional_days": 0, 
"additional_cost": 0.0, 
"allow_free_shipping": false, 
"active": true, 
"created_at": "2013-04-12T10:15:10-03:00", 
"updated_at": "2013-04-12T10:15:10-03:00" 
}  The shipping rate must contain the same CODE "express": 



{ 
"name": "Envio a domicilio express 24hs", 
"code": "express", 
"price": 14.15, 
"price_merchant": 14.15, 
"currency": "ARS", 
"type": "ship", 
"min_delivery_date": "2020-07-20T14:48:45-0300", 
"max_delivery_date": "2020-07-20T14:48:45-0300", 
"phone_required": true, 
"reference": "ref123" 
}, 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="about-destination-address">About destination address</h3>
<p>The destination address data may vary depending on where the shipping calculation is made and the data currently available.
In Tiendanube shipping calculations are made from different places on the platform, for example: the product page, the shopping cart, and the checkout. Depending on where the rates request is made, the destination address may have more or less information.</p>

<p>Product page and Cart: on these pages only the postal code will be sent as destination data to perform the calculation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"destination": { 
"name": null, 
"address": null, 
"number": null, 
"floor": null, 
"locality": null, 
"city": null, 
"province": null, 
"country": "AR", 
"postal_code": "1602", 
"phone": null 
},  At Checkout, all the data of the destination address will be sent, as long as it is a home delivery. Ex: 


"destination": { 
"name": null, 
"address": "Juan B. Justo", 
"number": "3000", 
"floor": null, 
"locality": "Nuñez", 
"city": "Capital Federal", 
"province": "Capital Federal", 
"country": "AR", 
"postal_code": "1602", 
"phone": null 
}, 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With these clarifications, Tiendanube wants to ensure that the buyer completes the checkout with a valid shipping option for their full address.</p>

<h3 id="reference-id">Reference id</h3>
<p>In the rate structure there is a field called reference. This is a field of free use that allows the APP to send an auxiliary value in the shipping calculation that you can later retrieve in the order at the time of processing the shipment. To consult this value, consult the endpoint orders, field shipping_option_reference.</p>

<p>Example:
**POST /your_callback_url **</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{ 
"store_id": 123456, 
"currency": "ARS",

} 
} 
] 
} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="free-shipping-in-mixed-carts">Free Shipping in mixed carts</h3>
<p>Mixed carts mean that one product has free shipping and another one has paid shipping, so we have to solve the shipping calculation for this specific scenario.
In the shipping rates query we will send to the callback_url all the information to perform the shipping calculation, among this information we will indicate which products have free shipping, and which do not, through the free_shipping = True / False attribute.
The following scenarios can occur:</p>
<h4 id="100-free-shipping">100% free shipping:</h4>
<p>All products in the cart have the property free_shipping = true. In this scenario, the APP should not take any additional action. Tendenube is responsible for applying the corresponding discounts. The APP must send the total shipping cost in the price and price_merchant fields.</p>
<h4 id="mixed-cart">Mixed cart:</h4>
<p>Some products have free shipping (free_shipping = true) and some products do not have free shipping (free_shipping = false). In this case, the APP must perform an additional calculation to obtain the cost with the discount applied for those products that have free shipping. Thus, the APP response will contain 2 (two) different costs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>price_merchant: Total shipping cost</li>
  <li>price: Total shipping cost with discount applied</li>
</ul>

<p>How to calculate the discount? Each shipping company can apply its own recipe to perform this calculation. Below we suggest a possibility to perform this calculation
    price = price_merchant - the cost of shipping the products with free_shipping=false</p>

<p><a name="management"></a></p>
<h2 id="shipment-management">Shipment management</h2>
<p>In this section on shipping management, the necessary interactions will be detailed so that the store can report new sales to the APP, and that the APP can obtain the order data to process the shipment.</p>

<h3 id="notification-of-shipments">Notification of shipments</h3>
<p>The shipping notification can be done individually, within the order detail, or in bulk in the order list.</p>

<p>These notifications are made through links within the Tiendanube admin that notify the APP about the existence of new shipments to manage. For this, the partner must create the corresponding admin links in the partner portal.</p>

<p>The admins allow you to send the ID of the store and the ID (or IDs) of the orders to notify the app and it can obtain the order data to start shipping management.</p>

<p>The admin links are made up of a partner URL whose parameters can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store = Store iD</li>
  <li>Locale = User language</li>
  <li>ID = Identification of the object of the page where the link is being displayed. Ex: When an Administrator link is displayed on the page of an order, we add its ID as parameters of the URL.
The URL that is formed may look like the following:
https://url.app?locale=pt&amp;store=937395&amp;id[]=128158567&amp;id[]=127034946</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-create-an-admin-link">How to create an admin link?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Access the application creation page in the Partner Panel</li>
  <li>Go to the bottom of the page until you get to the section “Administrator Links”</li>
  <li>Complete the fields with the link data that will be displayed:
a. Section: Select where the Link will appear: Area of the Tiedanube panel where you want the link to be displayed.
i. <strong>Order List **—&gt; For massive actions.
ii. **Details of an order</strong> —&gt; To trade on a particular order. 
b. <strong>Link Title</strong>: Text you want to be displayed to the user. 
i. <strong>Follow the following format</strong>: [APP Name] - [Acción]. example: 
Shipping Nube - Label printing, Shipping Nube - Notify shipments, etc. 
c. <strong>Icon</strong>: choose the icon that most closely relates to the action to be executed. 
d. <strong>URL</strong>: Address to which the user will be directed when clicking on the link. This is the URL to which we will add the parameters. 
Ex: https://url.do.link?locale=es&amp;store=937395&amp;id[]=128158567&amp;id[]=127034946</li>
  <li>Click on “Add a link” to save the action.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-else-can-i-use-the-admin-links-for">What else can I use the Admin Links for?</h3>
<p>The admin links are the bridge between Tiendanube and the APP delivery system. Any action that can be done in the APP can be published in the Tiendanube admin. This significantly improves the experience of our customers, optimizing operating times and therefore generating positive emotions that reinforce integration with the APP. Some ideas to improve the integration experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notify shipments</li>
  <li>Request package pickup</li>
  <li>Go to label printing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="process-the-order">Process the order</h3>
<p>To process the order, the data must be obtained. For this, make a request to the order endpoint using the store id and order id values, received in the admin link, to obtain the order data and process the shipment. <a href="https://github.com/TiendaNube/api-docs/blob/master/resources/order.md#get-ordersid" title="View more about get the order info">View more about get the order info</a></p>

<h3 id="reporting-a-tracking-code">Reporting a tracking code</h3>
<p>Once the shipment management has been done, the tracking number and the URL where to check the shipment status must be notified. For this, perform a POST to /orders/{id}/fulfill indicating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>shipping_tracking_url</li>
  <li>shipping_tracking_number</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TiendaNube/api-docs/blob/master/resources/order.md#post-ordersidfulfill" title="View more about hot to report shipping code">View more about how to report a tracking code</a></p>

<h3 id="shipping-status-update">Shipping status update</h3>
<p>Notification and visibility of a shipment’s status change is very important to buyers. Lower the levels of uncertainty and adjust the expectations of receiving the shipment. This translates to fewer interactions between consumers and store owners. For this reason, it is very important to be able to inform us about status changes on our tracking page.</p>

<p>You can see all the states that we support in the documentation. In order to update them, you have to do a POST to POST /orders/#{order_id}/fulfillments sending as much information as possible. This will mean that the buyer can accompany the order at all times on the order confirmation page. <a href="https://github.com/TiendaNube/api-docs/blob/master/resources/shipping_carrier.md#fulfillment-events" title="View more about shipping status update">View more about shipping status update</a></p>
